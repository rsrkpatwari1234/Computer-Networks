Number of  packets corresponding to SMTP : 28

Procedure : 

I put "smtp" in the display filter bar
All packets of SMTP protocol are diplayed
I went to "Statistics" in menu bar above and then selected "Capture File Properties"
It showed the details of all packets and data
So, it was given the 28 packets are displayed out of 5495 packets.

The same data also appears at the last of my wireshark screen , so I also verified from there.
